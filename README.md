This a small and complete project using Django. I developed it while giving
training to a group of graduate students. I am making it available here for
educational purposes.

The project requirements are given in 'ERMS.pdf'. 

To run the app, first you need to initialise the database

Run the following commands:

    manage.py makemigrations app_django
    manage.py migrate

Now run the following command to run the app:

    manage.py runserver
